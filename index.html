      <h2> Introduction</h2>

      <p>The TTCP CAGE Challenges are a series of public challenges instigated to foster the development of autonomous
      cyber defensive agents. The CAGE Challenges use cybersecurity scenarios inspired by real-world situations. The
      first CAGE Challenge https://github.com/cage-challenge/cage-challenge-1 was released to the public in August
      2021 and the second https://github.com/cage-challenge/cage-challenge-2in April 2022. The challenges use the
      Cyber Operations Research Gym (CybORG) to provide a high-fidelity cyber simulation for the training and
      evaluation AI algorithms such as Deep Reinforcement Learning. The CAGE activity aims to run a series of
      challenges of increasing complexity and realism. This CAGE Challenge 3 (CC3) is intended to present a new
      scenario that is tailored to some of the unique requirements of military systems.</p>
    

      <h2>Scenario narrative</h2>
      
      <p>“The nation of Florin is conducting reconnaissance on the border with Guilder during a period of tension between
      the two nations. A set of autonomous aerial drones is used to support soldiers patrolling the border. These
      drones are designed to form an ad-hoc network, so that any data the soldiers need to transmit to one another can
      be relayed via the drones as shown in Figure 1. The drones spread out across the area of interest and aim to
      maintain sufficient proximity with soldiers in order to enable communications. Guilder is not expected to
      attempt to destroy the drones, as this would be interpreted as an act of aggression. However, Guilder has
      experience in conducting cyber operations against Florin, and they may attempt to use their cyber capability to
      interfere with the mission.</p>
     
      <p>Cyber Threat Intelligence reports indicate that Guilder may have installed hardware Trojans on the drones in the
      swarm, however the conditions for the activation of the Trojans are unknown. Once activated, these Trojans will
      deploy a worm that will attempt to compromise other drones in the swarm. This worm may either steal data on
      Florin's troop movements, or introduce false information to mislead Florin command.</p>

      <p>You are a developer of autonomous defence systems. Following your success defending a Florin munitions factory
      against attack using autonomous agents (CAGE Challenges 1 and 2), you have been tasked with developing a
      multi-agent autonomous defence system for the drone support team. The drones are constantly moving, both to
      maintain the overall network and to track the movements of particular soldiers or vehicles. Communications
      between any two drones may drop out or be re-established at any time. A centralised approach to
      cyber defence will be difficult; instead, you will develop a decentralised defence system.</p>
      
      <p>Your primary goals are to defend the drone team such that (a) compromised drones are detected and then isolated
      or reclaimed, and (b) the flow of data between the soldiers using the network is maintained.”</p>
    
      <!-- INSERT IMAGE 1 HERE -->


      <h2>Challenge Details</h2>

      <p>The scenario for Challenge 3 is a team of 25 autonomous drone hosts forming an ad-hoc network. Each drone is an
      embedded Linux system and communicates via radio-based networking with any other systems (drones or troops
      underneath) that are physically close enough.</p>
      
      <p>The location of each drone is randomised at the beginning of each episode. The drones will then move according
      to a swarm algorithm to spread out across the area of interest. A drone may stop following the swarm algorithm
      to maintain sufficient proximity with soldiers in order to enable communications.</p>


      <p>Blue agents will start the game in control of all drones in the swarm and be distributed one agent per drone.
      The exploitation of the drones by the hardware Trojans will occur randomly during the episode and may occur
      multiple times in a single episode. When the Trojan activates, it will remove the agent on the drone and replace
      it with a Red agent.</p>
  
      <p>All drones in the swarm are of the same type and have the same vulnerabilities. The drones have a vulnerable
      service which is listening on port 8888 which an attacker can exploit to gain low privileged remote code
      execution. Drones have a wireless interface that establishes datalinks with all other drones that are within
      communication distance.</p>

      <p>Actions are performed by an agent to change the state of the environment. A full breakdown of the actions is
      provided in Appendix A. Actions are classified as either local or remote actions. Local actions are actions that
      can only act on the drone on which they are executed. Remote actions are actions that can act on any connected
      drone including the originating drone. Two drones are considered connected if there is a route between
      them.</p>

      <p>Remote actions use the ad-hoc network established in the drone swarm and follow one of the shortest routes
      between two drones. A shortest route is a path that passes through the least number of drones. A remote action
      may fail if any of the drones along the path drop the remote action's network traffic. A drone will still be
      considered connected even if its traffic is being dropped.</p>
      
      <p>Attackers, which we also call Red agents, use actions that exploit vulnerabilities on the drones to expand their
      control and compromise the transfer of data between patrols. Red team actions include ExploitDroneVulnerability,
      SeizeControl, FloodBandwidth, BlockTraffic, and AllowTraffic. If the ExploitDroneVulnerability is successful,
      the Red agent gains low privileged code execution on the target drone. This code execution can be followed up
      with the SeizeControl action to create a new Red agent with complete control over a drone and remove the Blue
      agent that is currently in control. Red agents can use FloodBandwidth to consume a large amount of bandwidth in
      the system, which may result in other agents' remote actions failing. The BlockTraffic and AllowTraffic actions
      give Red agents the ability to stop or allow traffic from a particular drone to enter and pass through the drone
      on which the action was executed. These actions will make a drone drop traffic from the targeted drone and may
      cause remote actions from that drone to fail.</p>
   
      <p>Defenders, which we also call Blue agents, use actions to inhibit Red agents' actions and retake control of
      compromised systems. Blue agents may use the RetakeControl, RemoveOtherSessions, BlockTraffic, and AllowTraffic
      actions. RetakeControl allows a Blue agent to remotely take control of a drone, removing any Red agents and low
      privileged sessions from that drone and replacing them with a new Blue agent. RemoveOtherSessions removes from
      the drone any low privileged code execution that belongs to another agent. BlockTraffic and AllowTraffic are
      identical to the Red actions.</p>
      
      <p>Both Red and Blue agents partially observe the environment based on the current state of the environment and the
      combination of actions chosen by all of the agents. An agent will have the most visibility of information
      relating to the drone on which it is hosted, termed its host drone. This information includes which IP addresses
      they have blocked, how much traffic they have flagged as malicious and which IP addresses sent that traffic. The
      agent observes the physical position of the drones that are connected. The flagging of malicious traffic may
      occur for any remote action acting on or routing through the drone. However, actions with malicious intent, such
      as the ExploitDroneVulnerability are more likely to be flagged than those that are benign, such as the SendData
      action. Each agent along the route taken by a remote action will independently assess the maliciousness of
      associated traffic. Agents may also observe the presence of processes on their drone that have been flagged as
      malicious. See Appendix B for the full breakdown of the agent observation.</p>
   
      <p>The partial observations of individual agents will limit their ability to coordinate a response to an attack.
      However, agents are able to communicate with other agents through an explicit broadcast, low-bandwidth
      communication channel. We use the standard broadcast paradigm for inter-agent communications, where each agent
      sends the same message to all other agents on connected drones, including agents on the other team. Due to
      bandwidth limitations, the size of the message is limited, however the message encoding is not prescribed. This
      will allow researchers to create their own communication protocols. To help researchers unfamiliar with
      multi-agent communication, we provide several example communication protocols. Researchers may choose to use the
      examples, modify the examples, write their own custom protocols, or expose the communication actions to agents
      to learn a protocol. </p>
   
        <!-- PRIV ESCALATION IMAGE HERE -->

      <p>Figure 2 shows the state transitions caused on a single drone by actions taken by agents on the Blue or Red
      team. Red agents that perform a successful exploit action against a drone will get low privileged code execution
      on that drone. If a Red agent performs a SeizeDrone action when it has low privileged code execution then it
      will replace the existing agent on the drone with a Red agent with high privileges. A Blue agent may use the
      RetakeControl action to remove any agent on a drone and replace it with a Blue agent with high privileges. If a
      Blue agent performs a RemoveOtherSessions action on a drone that is running low privileged code of a Red agent,
      then that code will be removed from the drone. All of these actions must meet preconditions to succeed, such as
      remote actions requiring a route to the target drone. Additionally, even if preconditions are met there is a
      probability of random failure to represent other factors that may cause failure such as a hardware glitch.</p>
      
      <p>In CAGE Challenges 1 and 2, Red agents performed discovery actions to find IP addresses and open port numbers,
      however this is not necessary in CC3. The agents that Guilder has deployed already know about the vulnerability
      on port 8888 and quickly collect the IP addresses of the drones in the network from the ARP cache on the host
      drone. Therefore, both the Red and Blue agents start the game with full knowledge of the IP addresses and ports
      that are present in the environment.</p>
      
      <p>To model data transfers between soldiers and determine the effectiveness of the agents, drones will attempt to
      transfer data to each other. This data transfer represents data being sent from one patrol to another and is
      performed by Green agents. The data transfer is executed by the SendData action, which is a remote action that
      consumes bandwidth, may be blocked, and follows the shortest paths if it exists. A data transfer will be deemed
      to have failed if the data is dropped due to a lack of bandwidth or traffic being blocked, or a Red agent along
      the data path is able to intercept or alter the data. The reward for the Blue team is shared across all agents
      and is based on the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of the transfer of data between drones.</p>

        </tr>
      </table>


      <p>Table 1 shows the potential rewards for different states of the environment. The reward received per time step
      by the Blue team is reduced by one for each failed data transfer attempt. Thus, the maximum reward the Blue team
      may receive is zero. Data transfers may fail because either a Red or Blue agent has used the BlockTraffic agent
      against the drone attempting to transfer the data, and that agent is along the data transfer path. A Red agent
      may have high privileges on a drone on the data transfer path, which allows that agent to intercept and
      potentially alter the data. This interception or alteration will also result in a failed data transfer. The data
      transfer will require a certain amount of available bandwidth and if that bandwidth is not available there is a
      chance that the data will be dropped. A Red agent may use the FloodBandwidth action to consume a large amount of
      bandwidth in the network, however all remote actions will use a certain amount of bandwidth. The swarming
      behaviour of the drones will alter their data links and may result in some drones becoming disconnected from
      other drones. A data transfer attempt will fail if no path between drones can be found. The goal of the Blue
      team is to ensure that the mission of the drones is successful and the reward function reflects that goal.</p>

      <p>The Blue team is able to permanently lose an episode. The SeizeControl action performed by Red agents removes
      Blue agents from drones. If all Blue agents are removed then the Blue team is unable to recover and fails the
      game. This will result in a massive negative reward that is the worst-case scenario of all drones failing to
      transfer data for the remaining time steps. A permanent Blue team loss will also return a True done signal from
      the environment. A True done signal is returned when the maximum number of time steps is reached. This
      represents the completion of the border patrol mission. </p>
